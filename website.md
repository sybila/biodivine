The BioDivine website is fully static and uses Material Design Components for styling and layout.

The website is generated by this root kotlin project. However, the project is primarily responsible
for generating the layout and gathering all content into the html files. The main pieces of content
are stored in the content directory using markdown syntax.

The tool then generates all html and scss files into the build directory where they are further 
processed using webpack.
