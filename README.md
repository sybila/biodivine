### BioDivine

BioDivine is a toolset for manipulation, analysis, validation, and verification of biological models. BioDivine provides three levels of functionality:
 - **Tools and tool integrations:** Designed for specific tasks with the user in mind, BioDivine tools provide graphical interfaces, input formats, and interactive visualisations suitable for "point-and-click" analysis.
 - **Interactive notebooks:** BioDivine integrates with the Jupyter notebook system, providing access to new or experimental features and allowing power users to easily combine, extend and modify its functionality.
 - **Libraries and frameworks:** All BioDivine functionality is implemented in a set of open source, extensible libraries. Well tested, high-performance, multiplatform code ready for you.

Note that this repository serves mainly as container for internal BioDivine documentation, website source code and other resources. For more information about functionality provided by BioDivine, visit the [BioDivine homepage](http://biodivine.fi.muni.cz).
